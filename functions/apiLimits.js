// GuyHadas Visibility OS - per-provider/operation cost & quota limits
// (Universal External API Cost-Control Rule - see the permanent rule in
// the project docs: claude/visibility-os-api-cost-control-rule.md).
//
// Plain, easily-tunable numbers - no logic lives here. functions/apiUsage.js
// reads this config to decide blocked_by_budget / blocked_by_quota /
// cache-validity before any provider is actually called. Raise these
// numbers as real usage proves they're safe to raise, not before - they
// are deliberately conservative starting points for a system with a
// handful of real businesses on it today, not a load-tested ceiling.
